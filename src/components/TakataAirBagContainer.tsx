                            In these vehicles, the propellant in the driver and/or passgener frontal air bag inflators
                            may degrade after prolonged exposure to high absolute humidity and fluctuating temperatures.
                            Degradeed propellant can cause inflator rupture during airbag deployment. In the event of an
                            inflator rupture, metal fragments could pass through the airbag cushion material, striking
                            the vehicle occupants, and result in serious injury or death.

                            Based on independent investigations and NHTSA’s independent expert, NHTSA has concluded that
                            the non-desiccated frontal Takata airbag inflators do not pose an unreasonable risk to
                            safety until they reach a certain level of propellant degradation. NHTSA and Takata are
                            prioritizing the expanded inflator recalls based on when involved inflators are more likely
                            to pose an unreasonable risk to safety, considering time, temperature, and environmental
                            moisture, which depends on a vehicle’s location (see map below).
